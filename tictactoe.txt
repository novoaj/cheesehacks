Classes
    Main class that will iniitalize the GUI with a blank grid
    Class "object": classes Circle and X that inherit from object
    We can keep track of the values in the grid with a 2d array
        This will help us determine when the game is over, who the winner is etc

    Additional ideas:
        maybe storing user information in a seperate file: info like wins and name
